I have experience in local government in Japan, regional revitalization, and UN communications. 

My research focuses on climate adaptation, disaster resilience, labor economics, and social infrastructure development using both qualitative and quantitative methods. I am passionate about policy analysis and the intersection of environment and economic policy.
