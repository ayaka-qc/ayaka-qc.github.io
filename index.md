Hi! I am Ayaka Naganuma, an incoming intern at the [UNFCCC](https://unfccc.int/) & [UN-Habitat](https://unhabitat.org/), and a master's student in [Public and International Affairs at the University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-social-sciences/public-international-affairs). 

I research climate change adaptation, disaster and climate risk, environmental inequality, and climate governance, using quantitative causal inference and environmental data analysis. My work examines climate-related labor risks, post-disaster recovery, and adaptation decision-making in climate-vulnerable regions.

I am passionate about producing evidence that supports equitable, data-driven climate policy.
